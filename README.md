## Why Sheet Plus?

Markdown tables are great for simple text, but they quickly fall apart when you need:

- formulas and calculations  
- filtering and sorting  
- structured datasets  
- frequent edits  
- charts and validation  

Sheet Plus was built to handle **real spreadsheet use cases inside Obsidian**, so your data can live right next to your notes — not in a separate app.

## What can you do with Sheet Plus?

- Create and edit spreadsheets visually inside Obsidian

- Validate data to avoid input errors  
- Create charts from spreadsheet data  
- Embed spreadsheets directly inside Markdown notes

All changes are saved inside your vault and work seamlessly with your existing notes.
